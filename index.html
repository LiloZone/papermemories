                        <h5 class="margin-b-50">Narratives, optical effects and representations of a perspective, are all illusions. The mapping experience is a way to explore these elements combined. Normally using digital animation and effects, we forgot that all those elements were explored in the beginning of the cinema and animation, with a lot of manual work. These same hands, are the ones writing the scripts, and the ones drawing and projecting spaces.
