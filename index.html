                        <p class="margin-b-50">Narratives, optical effects and representations of a perspective, are all illusions. The mapping experience is a way to explore these elements combined. Normally using digital animation and effects, we forgot that all those elements were explored in the beginning of the cinema and animation, with a lot of manual work. These same hands, are the ones writing the scripts, and the ones drawing and projecting spaces.</p>
                        <p class="margin-b-50">Our proposal is to explore the hybridity ways of producing moving image, combining paper cut, filming and digital effects to render an homage to paper, architecture and history.</p>
